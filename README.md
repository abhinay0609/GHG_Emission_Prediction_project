# GHG_Emission_Prediction_Project
This is a 4 week Edunet-Shell Skills4Future AICTE Internship focused on Green Skills & AI through project based learning.

**Project Title:** Grrenhouse Gas Emission Prediction

**Problem Statement:**
You have annual supply chain emission data from 2010â€“2016 categorized into industries and commodities. The goal is to develop a regression model that can predict the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins based on descriptive and quality metrics (substance, unit, reliability, temporal/geographical/technological/data collection correlations, etc.).

**Project Goal:**
To analyze and predict greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from various U.S. industries and commodities using the official dataset from data.gov.

**Source:**
Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors

**Tools:**
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

**Steps:**
Step 1: Import Required Libraries 
Step 2: Load Dataset 
Step 3: Data Preprocessing (EDA+Cleaning+Encoding) 
Step 4: Training 
Step 5: Prediction and Evaluation 
Step 6: Hyperparameter Tuning 
Step 7: Comparative Study and Selecting the Best model 


**Work Done in Week 1: **
1) Understood the Project Problem Statement and Project Goal. 
2) Understood the theoretical aspect of the project. 
3) Understood the Dataset. 
4) Implemented Step 1) Import Required Libraries and Step 2) Load the Dataset Code on colab and also understood the code.
